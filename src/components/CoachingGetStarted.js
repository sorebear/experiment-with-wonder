          Group coaching combines the principles of coaching with the small group context. It is a personal, specific space focused on discovering what’s happening now, what’s working, what isn’t and what to do about it. Sometimes, people find the expense of one-on-one coaching an obstacle.  Group Coaching is a great way to enroll others into session with Caitlin Baird, increasing the learning but reducing the individual cost per session.
